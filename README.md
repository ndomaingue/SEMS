Integration of SEMS Portal for Solar PV plant with IFTTT and Google Nest Mini Hub

I have recently had solar panels installed on my family home and am using the provided app on my mobile phone and web browser to view the data and statistics.  The inverter is from a Chinese company called GoodWe, and their app is called "SEMS Portal".  This app works fine, but I want to do more.

Specifically, I want to be able to make enquiries via my Google Nest Mini smart speaker, and have the Google Assistant speak to me to tell me interesting data about my onsite power generation.
